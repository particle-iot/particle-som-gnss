# Particle SOM GNSS Library

This standalone GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) library is designed specifically for Particle cellular modems with built-in GNSS support, including the M-SOM platform.  It provides a simple and efficient interface to access and utilize GNSS data for location-based applications on Particle devices.

## Note
This library is targeted for the M-SOM platform and can only be built with device OS version 5.8.2 and greater.

## Key Features
- Easy Integration: Seamlessly integrates with Particle devices equipped with GNSS functionality, allowing developers to quickly add location services to their IoT projects.
- Comprehensive GNSS Data: Access essential GNSS data, including latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, and heading, directly from your Particle device.
- Lightweight & Standalone: A lightweight library that doesn't require additional dependencies, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments.
- User-Friendly API: Provides a straightforward API to configure, control, retrieve GNSS data, and publish to console maps interfaces with location service.

## Installation
You can install the library via Particle's library manager on the command line, or by directly cloning this repository.
```bash
particle library add particle-som-gnss
```

If developing in VS Code, type this in the search bar:
```bash
>particle: install library
```

## API
### Configuration
`int begin(LocationConfiguration& configuration)`

The begin function initializes and configures the Location class using the provided configuration structure.

Parameters
- configuration: A LocationConfiguration structure that contains the configuration settings for the GNSS.

Returns
- int: Returns 0 on success. Any other value indicates a failure during the initialization process.

Defaults
- Passive GNSS antenna - no power applied through GNSS_ANT pin
- GPS+GLONASS constellations
- HDOP under 100 qualifies a fix
- Horizontal accuracy under 50 meters qualifies a fix
- Maximum time for fix is 90 seconds

### Acquisition
`LocationResults getLocation(LocationPoint& point, bool publish = false)`

The getLocation function retrieves the GNSS position synchronously (blocking). It blocks until the location is acquired.

Parameters
- point: A LocationPoint object that will be populated with the GNSS position data.
- publish: (Optional) If set to true, the location data will be published to the cloud after acquisition. The default value is false.

Returns
- LocationResults: An object containing the results of the location acquisition process.


`LocationResults getLocation(LocationPoint& point, LocationDone callback, bool publish = false)`

The getLocation function retrieves the GNSS position asynchronously. It returns immediately and executes the specified callback function upon completion of the acquisition.

Parameters
- point: A LocationPoint object that will be populated with the GNSS position data.
- callback: A LocationDone callback function that is invoked once the location acquisition is complete.
- publish: (Optional) If set to true, the location data will be published to the cloud after acquisition. The default value is false.

Returns
- LocationResults: An object containing the initial result of the location acquisition process.

## Example

See [examples](examples/) for more examples.

```cpp
void setup() {
    LocationConfiguration config;

    // Identify and enable active GNSS antenna power
    config.enableAntennaPower(GNSS_ANT_PWR);

    // Assign buffer to encoder.
    Location.begin(config);
}

void loop() {
    LocationPoint point = {};
    // Get the current GNSS location and publish 'loc' event
    auto results = Location.getLocation(point, true);
    if (results == LocationResults::Fixed) {
        Log.info("Position fixed");
    }
```
